Prameter Extraction from Least-Square Fitting

Goal:

1.	Construct a modular program that can accomplish least-square fitting and parameter extraction with simple graphical visualization.
2.	Familiarize with different iterative schemes in nonlinear optimization.
3.	Set up automatic verification in various levels of unit testing, numerical black-box testing and asymptotic testing as a first step towards an “expert” system.




Clarification:

•	Task 1: the implementation, testing and validation of matrix solver is in matrixSolver.java
•	The implementation of Task 2,4,6,7 are in mainP3.java
•	The code of Task 3 and Task 5 are in task3.matlab / task5.matlab
•	Related methods of this project are in EKVModel.java, rowFucntion.java(basic method of matrix) and test.java( method of second norm)
•	Checks for additional helper functions are in testClassP3.java
•	There are detailed output for task1, task6 task7 and testClass.
•	Simple output is in Project3SimpleOutput.txt
